# ThetaQuest

## **Inspiration** ✨💡🚀
**The inspiration behind ThetaQuest is to revolutionize the education sector by leveraging the power of blockchain technology, specifically the Theta blockchain.** We were driven by a vision to create an innovative and secure learning platform that combines gamification elements with the transparency and immutability of the blockchain. 

_**Our mission is to provide students with an engaging and immersive educational experience that transcends traditional boundaries. By integrating the decentralized nature of Theta blockchain, we aim to empower learners and foster a sense of ownership and achievement through the use of NFT rewards.**_

## **What it does** 🎮📚💪
ThetaQuest is not just another educational platform, but a gateway to a world of knowledge and excitement. It enables students to embark on thrilling quests, challenging quizzes, and interactive challenges created by passionate teachers. By paying with ThetaNFT or ThetaPass tokens, students gain access to a captivating learning environment where their progress and achievements are seamlessly recorded on the Theta blockchain. 
The platform harnesses the power of smart contracts to automatically determine quiz winners and instantly transfer unique NFTs as a token of recognition. Through intuitive dashboards, teachers can create personalized quizzes, set rewards, and track student performance, fostering a vibrant community of learning enthusiasts.

**About the App** 🚀✨
Our app provides an interactive learning experience for students while gamifying the process. Teachers can create quizzes and set them up within our app. Each quiz is assigned a unique six-digit code, allowing students to access and participate in the quiz. The quizzes are designed to be engaging, educational, and entertaining. 📚💡💪

**How It Runs** 🔧👷‍♀️👷‍♂️ 
Using the latest web technologies, our app is built on the Angular framework, with Node.js powering the backend. To ensure transparency, security, and immutability, we have integrated the Theta blockchain into the app's infrastructure. This allows us to maintain a decentralized record of quiz results and winners, ensuring trust and eliminating any possibility of tampering. 🎮🔒🔗

**Let's take a closer look at how our app operates:**
- 🔘 Quiz Creation: Teachers host quizzes and generate a unique six-digit code for each quiz.
- 🔘 Access and Participation: Students enter the code to gain access and participate in the quiz after paying a token set by the teacher.
- 🔘 Time Constraints: Each quiz has a predetermined start and end datetime, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging timely participation.
- 🔘 Quiz Pin Expiration: Once the end datetime passes, the quiz pin expires, preventing any further attempts to play the quiz.
- 🔘 One Attempt Policy: To ensure fairness, students can only play each quiz once, avoiding any advantage for repeated attempts.

## **Rewards and Winners** 🏆💫 
We believe in recognizing and incentivizing student achievements, and that's why we have implemented a reward system. Teachers have the flexibility to choose the number of winners and their respective rewards. Additionally, teachers set a participation token that is withdrawn from the students who want to participate in a quiz.

**Here's how the reward system works:**
🎁🏅 Performance-Based Selection: Winners are selected based on their performance in the quiz, and they are ranked from first place onwards.
🎉👏 Rewards for Winners: Students who fall within the range of selected winners will receive rewards, motivating them to excel and participate actively.

## **How we built it** 🔧👷‍♀️👷‍♂️
Building ThetaQuest was an exciting journey that brought together cutting-edge technologies and a shared passion for educational innovation. We utilized the versatility of Angular and TypeScript for the frontend, complemented by the robustness of Node.js for the backend infrastructure. Seamlessly integrating web3 functionalities, we leveraged the RPC-JSON endpoint of the Theta network to deploy smart contracts and facilitate smooth interactions with the blockchain. Adhering to the ERC20/TNT20 standards, our smart contracts efficiently handled token transactions, quiz hosting, award distribution, and NFT transfers. Rigorous testing and continuous UI/UX improvements were key to ensuring a seamless and delightful user experience.

## **Challenges we ran into** 🚧🔥🌪️
Throughout the development process, we encountered a series of challenges that tested our resilience and problem-solving skills. Designing a secure and efficient escrow system to manage tokens and facilitate award distributions demanded careful thought and meticulous planning. Integrating NFT functionality and establishing seamless communication between the frontend and backend components required thorough testing and debugging. Striking the perfect balance between gamification elements and educational content was a delicate task, necessitating iterative enhancements and valuable user feedback. However, our team embraced these challenges as opportunities for growth, innovation, and creating a platform that truly stands out.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of** 🏆🙌🎉
We are immensely proud of the accomplishments we've achieved with ThetaQuest. Seamlessly integrating web3 technologies, we successfully harnessed the power of the Theta blockchain to create a secure and transparent learning environment. Our smart contract implementation ensures seamless token transfers and NFT rewards, providing students with tangible recognition for their achievements. 

_**We take pride in the user-friendly dashboards we've developed, empowering both teachers and students to navigate the platform effortlessly. By gamifying the learning experience, we've created an engaging ecosystem that inspires a love for knowledge and encourages continuous growth. We are honoured to be part of the educational revolution enabled by the Theta blockchain.**_
